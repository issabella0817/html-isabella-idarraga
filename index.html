  Welcome to your life There's no turning back Even while we sleep We will find
  you Acting on your best behaviour Turn your back on mother nature Everybody
  wants to rule the world It's my own design It's my own remorse Help me to
  decide Help me make the most Of freedom and of pleasure Nothing ever lasts
  forever <br />
  Everybody wants to rule the world <br />
  There's a room where the light won't find you Holding hands while the walls
  come tumbling down When they do I'll be right behind you So glad we've almost
  made itm So sad they had to fade it
  <br /> <hr>
  Everybody wants to rule the world <br />
  I can't stand this indecision Married with a lack of vision Everybody wants to
  rule the world Say that you'll never never never never need it One headline
  why believe it? <br />
  Everybody wants to rule the world <br />
  All for freedom and for pleasure Nothing ever lasts for ever <br />Welcome to your life
  There's no turning back
